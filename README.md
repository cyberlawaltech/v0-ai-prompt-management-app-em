Author: Oluwaseun Lawal

STATUS: SYSTEM AUDIT IN PROGRESS | SECURITY LEVEL: TOP SECRET

🌌 01. MISSION BRIEFING

Prompt Improver is a high-performance, AI-powered Prompt Engineering platform built to architect, refine, and orchestrate complex LLM interactions. Designed with a Cyber-Security-First mindset, this application provides researchers and engineers with a tactical dashboard for agent creation, prompt reverse-engineering, and collaborative research.

[!IMPORTANT]
CURRENT HEALTH SCORE: 35/100 (Audit identifies missing Auth and Database layers. Protocol is currently in 'Sandbox' mode).
